<h1 align="center"> VHDL Wave </h1>
This extension allows you to invoke GHDL functions, as well as GTKWave to perform simlation of VHDL files. Beyond it highlights the errors that were reported by GHDL in the editor.

## Requirements

You will need to have [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases) and [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) installed on your system. Furthermore both must be set in your environment variables. 

## Usage

**GHDL**
At present it is possible to invoke the following GHDL functions by either rightclicking at the editor or at the explorer on the specific file and then selecting the desired funtion.

| Editor Option  | GHDL Function                  |
| -------------- | :----------------------------- |
| ghdl analyze   | `ghdl -a [File]`               |
| ghdl elaborate | `ghdl -e [Unit]`               |
| ghdl run       | `ghdl -r [Unit] [export file]` |
| ghdl clear     | `ghdl -c`                      |
| ghdl remove    | `ghdl -r`                      |

In addition to that the GHDL analyze function offers you error highlighting in the editor. 

**GTKWave**
To open your simulation files with GTKWave, simply rightclick on them (.ghw or .vcd file required) in the explorer and then select `gtkwave`

## Keybindings

It is also possible to invoke the GHDL functions via the following keybindings.

| Editor Option  | Windows          | Linux             | MacOS             |
| -------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| ghdl analyze   | `ctrl + alt + a` | `shift + alt + a` | `shift + cmd + a` |
| ghdl elaborate | `ctrl + alt + l` | `shift + alt + e` | `shift + cmd + e` |
| ghdl run       | `ctrl + alt + r` | `shift + alt + r` | `shift + cmd + r` |
| ghdl clear     | `ctrl + alt + c` | `shift + alt + c` | `shift + cmd + c` |
| ghdl remove    | `ctrl + alt + d` | `shift + alt + d` | `shift + cmd + d` |
